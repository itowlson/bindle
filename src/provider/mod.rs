//! The `Provider` trait definition and various implementations.
//!
//! A Bindle Provider can be anything that gives (e.g. "provides") access to Bindles. This could be
//! anything from a cache, to a proxy, or a storage backend (such as a database). Thus, Bindles can
//! be fetched from an arbitrarily complex chain of providers depending on the needs of your
//! team/code/organization.
//!
//! In general, we don't recommend too many nested chains in code
//! (`MyLocalCache<MyRemoteCache<SharedCache<CompanyCache<FileProvider>>>>` is not a happy thing in
//! code) and suggest using chains of proxies between various providers. In practice, it could look
//! like this (not real types): `LocalCache<Proxy> -> (Another server) Proxy -> (The server where
//! bindles are stored) DatabaseProvider` This pattern can be particularly useful in larger teams as
//! you could easily add another source of Bindles to your approved list of external sources at any
//! point along the chain
//!
//! ## Terminal Providers
//!
//! One concept that is not actually code, but is important to understand, is the idea of "Terminal
//! Providers." These are providers that mark the end of a chain and are generally the actual
//! storage/database backend where the Bindles exist. In general, Providers that are _not_ terminal
//! will generally contain another Provider implementation or an HTTP client to talk to another
//! server upstream
